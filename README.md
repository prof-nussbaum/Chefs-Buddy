# Chefs-Buddy
Agentic AI Assistant for the Modern Chef

We had a great time at out "Chef's Buddy" AI seminar at the Richmond, VA campus of ECPI University back in February of 2025. 
At the seminar, non-engineers (Culinary Students) saw how a first version of the "Chef's Buddy" AI Agent works.
The culinary students also got a chance to play around with popular free online LLM's.

Alongside the culinary students were Technology students (studying electronics engineering technology and other subjects).
The technology students had to gather further requirements by listening carefully to the ideas of the culinary students.
We hope to use these requirements to make improvements on the first version of Chef's Buddy.

This repository is a space where that work can take place.
The original source code for Chef's Buddy is located here, along with the gathered requirements.

We hope to use this repository to teach how to use Github, Agentic AI, and also light requirements tracking.
All are welcome to participate!
